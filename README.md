XULApp StarterKit
-----------------------------
XULApp StarterKit is a generic framework for XULRunner applications, like [Rich Client Platform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_client_platform) .

It provides the "plumbing" that, before, every developer had to write themselvesâ€”saving state, connecting actions to menu items, toolbar items and keyboard shortcuts;
 window management, add-ons mechanism, update mechanism and so on.

XULApp StarterKit provides a reliable and flexible application architecture.
An architecture that encourages sustainable development practices. Because the XULApp StarterKit architecture is modular, it's easy to create applications that are ro
bust and extensible.


Included in the distribution package:

* A minimal XUL application with a main skeleton window and an about dialog
* Auto-load Modules by Preferences System.
* Integrated [GREUtils](https://github.com/racklin/greutils) .
* Integrated [lodash](https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash) .
* A bundled [HTTP server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Httpd.js/HTTP_server_for_unit_tests) For HTML5 application or IPC.
* XULRunner 18 (Gecko 18)


XULApp StarterKit Build Scripts
-----------------------------
XULApp StarterKit include a collection of build scripts for packaging a XULRunner Application into distributable
bundles for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

5. run fetch_xulrunner.sh to downloading xulrunner runtime from ftp.mozilla.org.[ONLY ONCE]
6. run build.sh


Make your own application
-----------------------------
### Application in XULApp StarterKit Project

app/ directory contains standard XULRunner application structure.
Put your application files in app/ directory and modify app/chrome/content/xulapp/xulapp.xul main window.

### Application as First Add-on (Recommended)

Make your application as add-on and install to XULApp StarterKit.
This will make your application more flexible.

### Example Application Add-ons For XULApp StarterKit:
* [HTML5 Webapp Wrapper](https://github.com/racklin/xulapp-starterkit-app-webapp-wrapper).
    * Wrap and Packaging your HTML5 Web Application to XPI add-on.
    * PhoneGap Like.
* [XUL Periodic Table](https://github.com/racklin/xulapp-starterkit-app-xul-periodic-table).

### Example and Useful Add-ons For XULApp StarterKit:
* [SQLite Manager 0.7.7](https://github.com/racklin/xulapp-starterkit-addon-sqlitemanager).
* [DOM Inspector 2.0.12](https://github.com/racklin/xulapp-starterkit-addon-dominspector).
